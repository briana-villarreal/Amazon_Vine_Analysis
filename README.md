# Amazon Vine Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to conduct a meta-analysis of Amazon reviews, particularly reviews that comprise the Amazon vine program. In this program, selected members of the Amazon reviewer community review sample products and analysis is conducted to determine if any biases exist between the paid and unpaid review members. Upon looking at different product categories to conduct this analysis on, I chose to work with the Camera review category.  
## Results
To obtain my findings, I filtered the reviews to show only those that met the following two conditions: reviews with more than 20 votes and reviews that were more than 50% helpful. The following table was generated.

### Findings
* Out of 51,123 reviews in the dataset, 607 (1.19%) were paid and 50,516 (98.81%) were unpaid.

## Summary
### Conclusions
According to the results of my analysis, there is largely not a positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Rather, Vine reviewers may show a stronger tendency towards being more critical in their reviews, suggesting a negative bias. This possibility of a stronger negative bias could be examined by assessing the distribution of all star levels (1 through 5) for both paid and unpaid reviews.
